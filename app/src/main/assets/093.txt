093 – All Things Bright and Beautiful


Refrain
All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all.

1
Each little flow’r that opens
Each little bird that sings
He made their glowing colours
He made their tiny wings.

2
The purple-headed mountain
The river running by
The sunset and the morning
That brighten up the sky.

3
The cold wind in the winter
The pleasant summer sun
The ripe fruits in the garden
He made them, every one.

4
He gave us eyes to see them
And lips that we might tell
How great is God Almighty
Who has made all things well.
